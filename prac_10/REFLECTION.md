# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

It was almost good but varied depending on the project. If I was working on something new, my estimate accuracy would
be low but if I had concept already, the estimate was almost accurate.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

Yes, as I started getting the concepts, my estimate accuracy started increasing. At first, I was confused and took a lot
more than expected. But now, I think I can do a good estimation. 

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learned that it is crucial to make a goal and try to complete it by documenting. That way, I could easily detect my 
flaws and work on it.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

I learned that feedback can be an important thing for coding. Everyone is different and process things differently.
So it is crucial to receive feedback to learn more..

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

I have learned that all of us have different approaches but the result is always the same. By doing these reviews, I have
learned to chose the best out of the best approach and learn form it.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[Review 1](https://github.com/alikramaliziik/CP1404-PRACTICALS/pull/5/commits/2ba3223b2d22033c367fb151fe908d800feb34c0#r2264741576)

### Explanation

I gave feedback here about my opinion in this person's code. They wrote good comments so I appreciated it.

### Good Code Review 2

[Review 2](https://github.com/alikramaliziik/CP1404-PRACTICALS/pull/5/commits/597e0b4cd7b9cfa8b746067e6c474708d15ab154#r2264744915)

### Explanation

The person could've written in functions rather than a whole program in main. I suggested them to do it in functions

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I would change the way of giving instructions for the practical. Sometimes, its just too much to read all the instructions.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I improved my coding structures compared to Programming I. I have learned new things and I've noticed some good changes 
in my code structures.
